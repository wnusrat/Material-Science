I used this order to create my plots (similar to the video posted):

1) Wrote energy.dat output
2) Find folder with appropriate files (so ls, cd ___)
3) Then type gnuplot to open up gnuplot
4) Then open graph itself with plot "energy.dat"
5) Then, for kinetic, potential, and total energy, type:
6) plot for [i=2:4] "energy.dat" using 1:i
7) This gives plots of all three:
   - red curve is for kinetic energy
   - green curve is for potential energy
   - blue horizontal line is for the total energy
