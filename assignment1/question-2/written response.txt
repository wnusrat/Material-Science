a) If this were a real structure, we would expect that the epsilon value would be between 0.06 and 0.12 kcal/mol,
and the r_m values would be ~1.800 to ~2.000 angstroms. These values are typical for carbon-carbon and carbon -hydrogen
bonds. Therefore, I expect the real material to be a C3 crystal.

For bonds with larger differences in electronegativity, the r_m values become smaller, and the episilon values become
greater.

b) b) The modification required in the code to reflect the non-zero pressure is to introduce a limit for the particles to
fill to, or a finite range for the energies to be calculated. This is because, via the Van der Waals equation, the 
pressure going to infinity in an already filled container results in no space left for particles to move. Hence, a range
(e.g. for i in range (0, natom, 100):) can be used to account for pressure interactions.
